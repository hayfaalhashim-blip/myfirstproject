# Lab 1: Git & GitHub for ML Projects
Hi, I'm Haifa Alhashim.
I am a Cybersecurity and Digital forensics student with a strong interest in technology and data-driven systems. I am interested in Machine Learning because of its applications in security, data analysis, and intelligent systems. I also like to lift weights whenever I can!

Looking forward to learning more about machine learning in this course!
